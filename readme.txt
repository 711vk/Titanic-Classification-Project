Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
Introduction:
Stock price prediction is a critical aspect of financial market analysis, where accurate forecasting can significantly influence investment strategies and decision-making processes. With the advent of advanced machine learning techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have emerged as a powerful tool for time series forecasting, particularly in the domain of stock price prediction. LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are well-suited for this task due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
In this project, we aim to develop a model that predicts the future prices of a selected company's stock using historical price data. By leveraging LSTM, we intend to create a robust predictive model that can analyse past stock prices and forecast future values, providing insights into potential market movements.
How the Stock Price Prediction Project Works
This project leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the project works:
1. Data Collection:
* The project starts by collecting historical stock price data for a specific company. This data typically includes daily prices such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, etc. For this project, the Close price is usually the target variable for prediction.
2. Data Preprocessing:
* Normalisation: The collected data is normalised (scaled) to ensure that all values are within a similar range, typically between 0 and 1. This is crucial for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the LSTM model.
* Dataset Preparation: The normalised data is then transformed into a format suitable for the LSTM model. This involves creating sequences of data (X) with a specific time step (e.g., the past 100 days) to predict the next data point (Y). For example, if the time step is 100, the model uses the previous 100 days' stock prices to predict the price on the 101st day.
3. Model Building:
* LSTM Network Construction: An LSTM neural network is constructed using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or Keras. The network typically consists of multiple LSTM layers that are capable of learning the temporal dependencies in the data, followed by fully connected layers to produce the final output.
* Training the Model: The prepared data is split into training and testing sets. The LSTM model is trained on the training data by adjusting its weights over several epochs to minimise the prediction error (loss). The model learns to predict future stock prices based on the patterns it identifies in the historical data.
4. Model Prediction:
* After training, the model is tested on the unseen test data. The model predicts stock prices for the test set, and these predictions are compared to the actual stock prices to evaluate the model’s performance.
5. Evaluation:
* Performance Metrics: The model’s performance is assessed using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine how close the predicted prices are to the actual prices.
* Visualisation: The project typically includes visualising the model's predictions against the actual stock prices, allowing for an intuitive understanding of how well the model is performing. The results show the model’s ability to predict trends and price movements over time.
6. Conclusion and Insights:
* The project concludes with an analysis of the model's predictions. While the LSTM model can effectively capture temporal patterns in the stock price data, it’s important to acknowledge that stock prices are influenced by numerous external factors not captured in this model, such as market news, economic indicators, and geopolitical events. Therefore, this model should be used as part of a broader strategy for stock market analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion:
